## [unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-02

### Security
- **Boot security preflight.** At startup the harness hardens its own process
  (`PR_SET_DUMPABLE=0`, `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS=1`) so a co-resident opencode agent (same uid)
  cannot read the harness's `/proc/<pid>/{environ,mem}` or ptrace it, and fail-closes on unsafe
  host gates (running as root, `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`). A soft-warn nudges toward
  dropping the capability bounding set. `ACH_INSECURE_ALLOW_DEGRADED=1` downgrades the host gates
  to warnings for local dev; the two `prctl` hardenings are always enforced.
- **Inbound-auth secrets are env-only.** `webhook.auth.secret` / `a2a.auth.secret` are read from
  environment variables the operator injects (e.g. via `secretKeyRef`); the rendered config carries
  env **names**, never values. Secret env values are redacted from logs, and any secret env name is
  stripped from `engine.forwardEnv` (with a warning) so it never reaches opencode's clean-slate env.

### Added
- **Keyed engine pool.** The opencode engine pool is keyed by `session_key` — one agente ⇄ one
  `session_key` (1:1). Distinct keys run parallel agentes; the same key reuses one, serialized by
  the router lane. Per-session opencode config via `OPENCODE_CONFIG` over a shared HOME.
- **Warm engine reuse + `channel.session: auto|none`.** Configurable idle TTL keeps an agente warm
  for session continuity; `auto` reuses the opencode session across turns, `none` starts fresh.
- **Engine resilience.** Bounded, health-gated SSE reconnect on the live invocation path;
  mid-invocation liveness fails fast when opencode dies during a turn; a single owner enforces
  `maxInvocationSeconds` with force-kill on timeout and reserved-port release on stop.
- **Step-budget abort.** Runaway turns are bounded by tool-call count, followed by a wrap-up
  correction turn so the agent still produces a terminal response.
- **Per-turn observability.** Structured logs for the prompt, each tool call (once, completed/error),
  and a per-turn summary (tools, tokens, cost, duration).
- **Configurable GitLab event routing.** `webhook.gitlabEvents` selects which events route
  (MR / issue / comments), ignores the rest, and never 422s on non-routable notes; per-kind default
  prompts (MR / issue / comment). GitLab dual-key dedup adds a logical-content composite as a
  secondary dedup key. Webhook 202 responses carry a correlation `X-ACH-Task-Id`.
- **Memory backend package.** Per-`memory.type` boot-static tool spec in the system prompt;
  `codemem.project` / `hindsight.bank` are `{{ }}`-templated from the event; strict nested
  `memory.<type>.*` schema.
- **Frozen config JSON Schema.** Published `docs/schemas/agent-config-v1.schema.json` with a drift
  guard and `make schema` target.
- **`ach-stats` service (sub-project A).** A standalone dashboard service reading the harness
  `ach:sessions` redis stream and serving a usage leaderboard (FastAPI + React SPA). The harness gains
  a non-blocking `StatsSink` (supervised redis writer with `XADD`+`MINID` trim, Prometheus counters).

### Changed
- **BREAKING — `auth.secretPath` removed; `auth.secret` is a `{env: NAME}` source.** File-backed
  secrets are gone: a `{file}` source is rejected at config load. Operators must inject the secret as
  an environment variable and reference it by name. Lockstep change with `ach-runtime`.
- Webhook config key `gitlab_events` renamed to camelCase `gitlabEvents`.

### Fixed
- Messages are accepted independently of engine readiness (the acceptance path no longer blocks on a
  warm engine), and the warm engine pool is stopped on graceful shutdown (no orphaned opencode).
- `CODEMEM_PROJECT` is pinned so codemem cross-session recall works; the engine HOME layout uses the
  contract-correct prompt path and an off-volume tmp dir.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- **`prompt.system` typed source: `text` | `file` | `ach`.** The persona can be inline
  (`{type: text, text: "…"}`), a hydrated prompt file addressed by path
  (`{type: file, file: "prompts/<name>/<f>.md"}`), or a hydrated prompt addressed by name
  (`{type: ach, ach: "<name>", file?: "<subpath>"}`, the preferred form — the harness
  resolves the prompt dir's sole file, or the given subpath). Paths resolve under
  `<home>/.ach-state`; absolute or `..` is rejected at load and re-checked (real path) at
  read time; a missing file/dir is a hard boot failure (never fail-open).
- **`memory.type` backend union: `hindsight` | `codemem`.** `hindsight` (default) keeps the
  existing `endpoint`/`bank`/`mentalModels` shape; `codemem` is a local stdio-MCP,
  model-managed backend taking an absolute `dbPath`. A legacy memory block with no `type`
  defaults to `hindsight`. codemem fails open (PATH probe) and is wired into opencode.json.

### Changed
- **BREAKING — `prompt.system` is no longer a plain string.** The bare-string form is
  rejected; the operator (and hand-authored configs) must render the object form above.
  Lockstep change with `ach-runtime`.
- **Hydrated `prompts`/`artifacts` relocated to `<home>/.ach-state/{prompts,artifacts}/<name>`**
  (was `<mountPath>/{kind}`); a `<workDir>/.ach-state` symlink gives the agent one path.
  Skills are unchanged (`<home>/.config/opencode/skills/<name>`).

### Removed
- **Helm chart + Kustomize base (`deploy/`)** and the chart-publish step in the release
  workflow. The harness is deployed by the `ach-runtime` operator, which owns the
  `Deployment` (CONTRACT §1); the standalone chart was a redundant, unexercised second
  deployer. Released container images are still published to `ghcr.io/ackstorm/ach-agent`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **`engine.forwardEnv`** (config) — a list of extra env var NAMES to forward from the
  harness env into the opencode subprocess. Defaults to empty.
- **`capability.filter.exclude.mcpServers` + `.skills`** — withhold MCP servers and ACH
  skills before they reach the model (governance gate); plus existing `.tools` now enforced
  via opencode.json tool-disable.
- **`header_token` webhook auth** — static shared secret in a configurable header.
- **Per-channel `concurrency`** — each channel's `concurrency` is now a real sub-cap under
  the global `maxConcurrentInvocations`.
- **`maxSteps` and `terminalOutputRetries`** are now honored (were parsed but ignored).
- **`engine.home`** (config) — the opencode HOME (config, hydrated skills, sessions,
  node_modules). Definable; defaults to `<persistence.mountPath>/home` when persistence is
  enabled, else `/tmp/ach-home`. `engine.workDir` now defaults to `<home>/workspace`.

### Changed
- **`memory.scope` renamed to `memory.bank`** — the static memory bank_id (the agent's
  mission namespace, e.g. `gitlab-pr-review`). Per-event tag-based partitioning is a
  separate future layer and does not affect this field.
- **`channel.prompt` is now rendered** through a zero-dependency `{{ }}` substitution
  engine. Namespaces: `payload.*` (inbound JSON body) and `internal.*` (`channel.name`/
  `type`/`source`, `agent.name`, `memory.bank`, `event.id`, `session.key`); one filter,
  `| default("x")`. There is no `env` namespace — process env (the `ek_`) is structurally
  unreachable from a template (ek-hygiene at the template layer). Channels without a
  `prompt` keep the previous built-in instruction behavior unchanged.
- **Config reshape:** `workDir` + `startupTimeoutSeconds` moved under `engine`;
  `prompt.base` → `prompt.system`.
- **`--tui` now attaches to opencode's native TUI** via `opencode attach` against the
  harness-prewarmed `serve` (egress hygiene preserved — model + MCP still flow through the
  localhost proxies that inject the `ek_`). `--debug` remains the plain stdin/stdout REPL.
- **ACH skills now load in opencode** — hydrated skills extract flat into
  `<home>/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (the directory opencode scans), instead of
  `persistence.mountPath/skills/<qualified-name>/<name>/` (which opencode never read).
- **opencode HOME is now a single stable dir** (`engine.home`) instead of a fresh per-server
  `mktemp`, so sessions and node_modules persist. `tui-attach.log` moved to a volatile
  `/tmp/ach-harness/`.

### Removed
- **`agent.namespace`, `agent.generation`, top-level `governed`, `channels[].session`,
  `channels[].expire`, `engine.idleTtlSeconds`** — inert or redundant; dropped to close the
  contract.
- **`ACH_OPENCODE_BIND_HOST` and `ACH_OPENCODE_PORT`** — opencode `serve` now always binds
  loopback (`127.0.0.1`) on a free ephemeral port. The off-host web-UI exposure they enabled
  is obsolete now that `--tui` uses `opencode attach` (co-located, loopback); dropping the
  `0.0.0.0` bind also removes an unauthenticated-API footgun.
- **Legacy direct-gateway model mode** — opencode.json no longer falls back to
  `{env:ACH_API_KEY}` / `{env:ACH_BASE_URL}` when no localhost proxy is configured. opencode
  always reaches the model through the localhost model-proxy, so **`ACH_TOKEN` (the `ek_`) is
  now required**: the harness hard-fails at boot without it (no model endpoint). Removes the
  one path where opencode read a key directly from its env.
- **`EngineConfig.session_dir`** — dead field (set, never read); opencode persists sessions
  under `<home>/.local/share/opencode`.

### Security
- **opencode's subprocess env is now built clean-slate** instead of inheriting the full
  harness environment. opencode gets only a small base allowlist (`PATH`, `SHELL`, `LANG`,
  …) plus any names in `engine.forwardEnv`; `HOME`/`TMPDIR` are pinned to its ephemeral
  home. This enforces CONTRACT §3 — the `ek_` (`ACH_TOKEN`/`ACH_API_KEY`) never reaches
  opencode in proxy mode (previously the subprocess inherited `**os.environ`, including the
  bearer). Legacy local-dev mode (no localhost proxy) still forwards `ACH_API_KEY`/
  `ACH_BASE_URL`, which opencode.json dereferences directly.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **`ACH_OPENCODE_PORT`** pins the opencode `serve` port (default `0` = ephemeral). Set a
  fixed port so a container can publish it (`ports:`) and the opencode web UI is reachable
  from the host. Pair with `ACH_OPENCODE_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0`. Dev/test only — collides if two
  harness instances share the port.

### Fixed
- **Queue consumers are stopped before the graceful drain** so in-flight redelivery can't
  re-enqueue work mid-drain.
- **Redis `xack` failures are guarded** in the queue consumer (a failed ack no longer
  escapes the consume loop).
- **Dedup mark reads the clock once** in the router, removing a read-time skew between the
  TTL stamp and the window check.
- **Removed the 300s cap on MCP/model proxy upstream calls** — long-running upstream
  requests (e.g. a slow MCP tool) are no longer truncated by the localhost proxy.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **`ACH_OPENCODE_BIND_HOST`** controls the interface opencode `serve` binds to (default
  `127.0.0.1`). Set to `0.0.0.0` to expose the opencode HTTP API + web UI on all interfaces
  (e.g. to open the web UI from your host's browser). Binding a non-loopback interface logs a
  loud security warning — the opencode API runs without authentication, dev/test only. The
  harness HTTP client always connects via loopback regardless.
- **`--tui` pre-warms opencode at boot**: the console now launches the opencode server up
  front (instead of lazily on the first prompt) and holds it for the whole REPL, so there is
  no idle TTL between prompts — only Ctrl-C / EOF ends the session.

### Changed
- **Engine idle TTL is now a per-channel constant** (`_CHANNEL_IDLE_TTL_S`), `0` for all v1
  channels, so the opencode server stops as soon as a conversation ends. Replaces the global
  `ACH_ENGINE_IDLE_TTL_SECONDS` env / `engine.idleTtlSeconds` resolution. The
  `engine.idleTtlSeconds` config field is retained for back-compat but no longer has any effect.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-26

### Changed
- **opencode runtime bumped `1.16.0` → `1.17.11`** (`OPENCODE_VERSION` in the Dockerfile).
  Verified live against ACH (streaming console + tool chrome + calendar MCP flow).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Live streaming console**: the `--tui`/`--prompt` console now streams the assistant's
  text as it is produced and shows one-line tool-lifecycle chrome (`⚙ running` / `⚠ error`),
  so a long-blocking tool (e.g. a calendar `auth_wait`) is no longer dead air. Text comes
  from opencode's cumulative `message.part.updated` snapshots (suffix-diffed per part).
- **Model-proxy upstream override (dev/test only)** via `ACH_MODEL_BASE_URL` /
  `ACH_MODEL_HEADER` / `ACH_MODEL_TOKEN`: swap just the model backend (hydration + MCP stay
  on `ACH_BASE_URL`) to A/B a different gateway. The token is injected verbatim as the header
  value. Uses a raw provider key, not the `ek_` — bypasses ACH governance; never for production.
- **`ACH_DEBUG_SSE=1`** raw per-event SSE trace and **`ACH_LOG_LEVEL`** console verbosity knob.
- **Boot-time MCP tool probe**: lists the tools each hydrated MCP server exposes and warns when
  a server returns zero (surfaces an unauthorized/unconsented server at boot, not mid-invocation).

### Changed
- **`capability.ach.baseUrl` is now optional and overridable via `ACH_BASE_URL`**: the env var,
  when set, wins over the contract's `baseUrl` (and supplies it when the contract omits it).
  `load_config` hard-fails only if neither provides a host. The shipped `docker/` sample +
  quickstart configs no longer carry a hardcoded ACH host — they expect `ACH_BASE_URL` at runtime.

### Fixed
- **Clear boot failure on an unresolvable model endpoint**: when neither an `ek_` (`ACH_TOKEN`)
  nor `ACH_BASE_URL` is set, the harness now exits at boot with an actionable message instead
  of letting opencode fail every invocation with the opaque
  `"/chat/completions" cannot be parsed as a URL`. Also warns when `ACH_MODEL_TOKEN` carries an
  empty credential (e.g. an unexpanded `${...}` var).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- **Proxy teardown latency**: bounded the localhost MCP/model proxy `shutdown_timeout` to 1s.
  aiohttp's 60s default made shutdown hang ~60s after the reply when a long-lived MCP/SSE
  stream was still open.

### Changed
- **Slimmer image (−21MB, 339→318)**: dropped `uvicorn[standard]` (the uvloop/httptools/
  websockets/watchfiles extras aren't needed for this single-replica surface) and pruned
  `__pycache__`/`*.pyi`/bundled test suites from deps.
- **`capability.ach.environment` is now optional** (defaults to `"platform"`): the EK scopes
  the environment server-side, so hand-authored configs can omit it.

### Added
- `docker/quickstart/` — standalone `docker-compose.yaml` + `config.yaml` using the public
  image (`docker compose run --rm agent`).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-26

The v1.1 milestone — engine rescoped to **opencode** with localhost-proxy ek-hygiene,
full v3-contract alignment, and a zero-friction local dev-loop.

### Added
- **YAML-authored contracts**: `load_config` accepts `.yaml`/`.yml`, validated against the
  same schema as the rendered JSON contract.
- **`--prompt TEXT`** one-shot launch modifier (non-interactive sibling of `--tui`): boot,
  run a single free-form prompt, print the reply, exit.
- **`--tui`** launch modifier: boot engine/proxies/hydration and run a console REPL,
  ignoring configured channels (the typed line is the prompt).
- **Localhost reverse-proxy** fronting model + MCP that injects the ACH key (`ek`), so
  opencode never sees it (§6.10 ek-hygiene).
- **Hydration** via `POST /platform/hydrate`; context (skills/prompts/artifacts) downloaded
  and extracted (path-traversal guarded).
- **Channels**: webhook (gitlab|github|generic + auth), cron, queue (redis Streams), a2a (async).
- **Runnable container**: opencode baked in, default contract baked, `ENTRYPOINT` so
  `docker run -it -e ACH_TOKEN=ek-... IMAGE --tui` works with zero mounted files.
- `prompt.base` wired into opencode's append-mode `instructions` (inline agent persona).

### Changed
- Engine reverted to **opencode** (`opencode serve` + SSE); single-object terminal contract
  (`{action,text,thoughts}`), harness-validated (extract + Pydantic + ≤1 repair).
- ACH auth via the **`x-ach-key`** header; `ek-` keys; `runtime.models` are objects
  `{id,endpoint}` and the model proxy uses the model's real endpoint path.

### Removed
- slack/telegram channels + the Hermes dependency; harness-side delivery (egress is
  model-initiated via external MCP, never posted on the model's behalf).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-22

First public release — the v1.0 MVP of the ACH execution-plane harness.

### Added

- **Engine bridge** — drive the opencode engine over HTTP/SSE (`opencode serve`): subprocess
  launch with a startup deadline (`sys.exit(1)` on timeout), SSE text-accumulation action
  extraction, the `maxInvocationSeconds` watchdog, a bounded repair turn, a shared/TTL engine
  pool, and `ek_` bearer redaction.
- **Router (core IP)** — per-session FIFO lanes enforcing the pinned `dedup → backpressure →
  lane` order with three always-enforced finite bounds (`maxConcurrentInvocations`,
  `maxInvocationSeconds`, `maxQueuedTotal`).
- **Channels** — `webhook` (GitLab MR, HMAC body auth, real dedup from `X-Gitlab-Event-UUID`),
  `slack`, `telegram`, `a2a`, and `cron` (croniter with deterministic dedup keys), all
  normalized to a canonical `MessageEvent`.
- **Actions** — `reply` and `gitlab_comment` delivery (synchronous and out-of-band); a
  consent-gated, dry-run `sideEffect` path with an audit trail.
- **Durability** — dedup store with a split fail policy, graceful drain on `SIGTERM` preserving
  in-flight invocations, and the A′ proven-start admission gate.
- **Memory** — fail-open memory adapter: degrade and continue when the backend is unreachable.
- **HTTP surface** — inbound channel events, `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/metrics`.
- **Conformance** — the authoritative CONTRACT §6 conformance suite (`make conformance`),
  chained into `make verify`.
